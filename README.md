# Customer-Churn-Analysis_PowerBI-Python
In this project, I conducted a comprehensive customer churn analysis on a telecom dataset obtained from Kaggle. To showcase my Power BI skills, I structured the report with a table of contents and a summary page for easy navigation. The report consists of dedicated pages for Customer Details and Churn Reasons, allowing for focused exploration. Prior to building the Power BI report, I performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to identify significant attributes, particularly related to gender and other pertinent factors. Visualizations such as charts and graphs were employed to effectively communicate insights. The report is designed to be interactive, enabling users to engage with data through filters and zoom functionality. Throughout the report, I provided insightful interpretations of the data, highlighting trends and correlations. By following this structured approach, I aimed to present a clear, informative, and visually appealing analysis of customer churn, leveraging the capabilities of Power BI.
